# ISS Tracker - neuefische recap project

This is an ISS Tracker app, which tracks the current location of the ISS with a refresh button and a refresh interval of 3 seconds. This was my first next.js data fetching task within my neuefische web development bootcamp in which we used a template for the map visuals and implemented a data fetch and the interval.
